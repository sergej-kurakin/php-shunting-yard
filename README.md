Master: [![Master Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sergej-kurakin/php-shunting-yard.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sergej-kurakin/php-shunting-yard)
Develop: [![Dev Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sergej-kurakin/php-shunting-yard.png?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/sergej-kurakin/php-shunting-yard)

## Example

Simple equation parsing
```php
use RR\Shunt\Parser;

$equation = '3 + 4 * 2 / ( 1 - 5 ) ^ 2 ^ 3';
$result = Parser::parse($equation);
echo $result; //3.0001220703125
```

Equation with constants and functions
```php
use RR\Shunt\Parser;
use RR\Shunt\Context;

$ctx = new Context();
$ctx->def('abs'); // wrapper for PHP "abs" function
$ctx->def('foo', 5); // constant "foo" with value "5"
$ctx->def('bar', function($a, $b) { return $a * $b; }); // define function

$equation = '3 + bar(4, 2) / (abs(-1) - foo) ^ 2 ^ 3';
$result = Parser::parse($equation, $ctx);
echo $result; //3.0001220703125
```
